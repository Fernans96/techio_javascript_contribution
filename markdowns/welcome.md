## In this course, there will be 3 useful and cool JavaScript libraries presented to you.

-  **Babel.js**: A JavaScript-to-JavaScript compiler to use the most recent JavaScript syntax and compile it to older syntax for backward compatibility.

-  **Mocha.js**: A JavaScript unit test framework.

-  **Chart.js**: A front-end library used to easily create charts and graphs.

## Have fun!
